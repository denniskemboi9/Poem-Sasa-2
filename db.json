            "content": "Have you heard the story that gossips tell \nOf Burns of Gettysburg?\u2014No? Ah, well, \nBrief is the glory that hero earns, \nBriefer the story of poor John Burns: \nHe was the fellow who won renown,\u2014 \nThe only man who didn't back down \nWhen the rebels rode through his native town; \nBut held his own in the fight next day, \nWhen all his townsfolk ran away. \nThat was in July, Sixty-three, \nThe very day that General Lee, \nFlower of Southern chivalry, \nBaffled and beaten, backward reeled \nFrom a stubborn Meade and a barren field. \nI might tell how but the day before \nJohn Burns stood at his cottage door, \nLooking down the village street, \nWhere, in the shade of his peaceful vine, \nHe heard the low of his gathered kine, \nAnd felt their breath with incense sweet \nOr I might say, when the sunset burned \nThe old farm gable, he thought it turned \nThe milk that fell like a babbling flood \nInto the milk-pail red as blood! \nOr how he fancied the hum of bees \nWere bullets buzzing among the trees. \nBut all such fanciful thoughts as these \nWere strange to a practical man like Burns, \nWho minded only his own concerns, \nTroubled no more by fancies fine \nThan one of his calm-eyed, long-tailed kine,\u2014 \nQuite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact, \nSlow to argue, but quick to act. \nThat was the reason, as some folks say, \nHe fought so well on that terrible day. \n\nAnd it was terrible. On the right \nRaged for hours the heady fight, \nThundered the battery's double bass,\u2014 \nDifficult music for men to face; \nWhile on the left\u2014where now the graves \nUndulate like the living waves \nThat all that day unceasing swept \nUp to the pits the Rebels kept\u2014 \nRound shot ploughed the upland glades, \nSown with bullets, reaped with blades; \nShattered fences here and there \nTossed their splinters in the air; \nThe very trees were stripped and bare; \nThe barns that once held yellow grain \nWere heaped with harvests of the slain; \nThe cattle bellowed on the plain, \nThe turkeys screamed with might and main, \nAnd brooding barn-fowl left their rest \nWith strange shells bursting in each nest. \n\nJust where the tide of battle turns, \nErect and lonely stood old John Burns. \nHow do you think the man was dressed? \nHe wore an ancient long buff vest, \nYellow as saffron,\u2014but his best, \nAnd, buttoned over his manly breast, \nWas a bright blue coat, with a rolling collar, \nAnd large gilt buttons,\u2014size of a dollar,\u2014 \nWith tails that the country-folk called 'swaller.' \nHe wore a broad-brimmed, bell-crowned hat, \nWhite as the locks on which it sat. \nNever had such a sight been seen \nFor forty years on the village green, \nSince old John Burns was a country beau, \nAnd went to the 'quiltings' long ago. \n\nClose at his elbows all that day, \nVeterans of the Peninsula, \nSunburnt and bearded, charged away; \nAnd striplings, downy of lip and chin,\u2014 \nClerks that the Home Guard mustered in,\u2014 \nGlanced, as they passed, at the hat he wore, \nThen at the rifle his right hand bore; \nAnd hailed him, from out their youthful lore, \nWith scraps of a slangy repertoire: \n'How are you, White Hat? Put her through!' \n'Your head's level!' and 'Bully for you!' \nCalled him 'Daddy,'\u2014begged he'd disclose \nThe name of the tailor who made his clothes, \nAnd what was the value he set on those; \nWhile Burns, unmindful of jeer and scoff, \nStood there picking the rebels off,\u2014 \nWith his long brown rifle and bell-crown hat, \nAnd the swallow-tails they were laughing at. \n\n'Twas but a moment, for that respect \nWhich clothes all courage their voices checked: \nAnd something the wildest could understand \nSpake in the old man's strong right hand, \nAnd his corded throat, and the lurking frown \nOf his eyebrows under his old bell-crown; \nUntil, as they gazed, there crept an awe \nThrough the ranks in whispers, and some men saw, \nIn the antique vestments and long white hair, \nThe Past of the Nation in battle there; \nAnd some of the soldiers since declare \nThat the gleam of his old white hat afar, \nLike the crested plume of the brave Navarre, \nThat day was their oriflamme of war. \n\nSo raged the battle. You know the rest: \nHow the rebels, beaten and backward pressed, \nBroke at the final charge, and ran. \nAt which John Burns\u2014a practical man\u2014 \nShouldered his rifle, unbent his brows, \nAnd then went back to his bees and cows. \n\nThat is the story of old John Burns; \nThis is the moral the reader learns: \nIn fighting the battle, the question's whether \nYou'll show a hat that's white, or a feather!",

E. and R. C'; it was Charlotte who gave them this title. The image of two children appears a number of times in Emily Bront\u00eb's poetry as well as in her novel. In this poem, the 'melancholy boy' resembles Heathcliff and Hareton, while the 'Child of Delight! with sunbright hair' resembles Catherine Earnshaw and Cathy Linton; the poem hints that they are to redeem the 'melancholy boy.' The dark-light, male-female pair appears in the novel and in the Gondal saga as well.",
