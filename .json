        "content": "Still the mind smiles at its own rebellions,\nKnowing all the while that civilization and the other evils\nThat make humanity ridiculous, remain\nBeautiful in the whole fabric, excesses that balance each other\nLike the paired wings of a flying bird.\nMisery and riches, civilization and squalid savagery,\nMass war and the odor of unmanly peace:\nTragic flourishes above and below the normal of life.\nIn order to value this fretful time\nIt is necessary to remember our norm, the unaltered passions,\nThe same-colored wings of imagination,\nThat the crowd clips, in lonely places new-grown; the unchanged\nLives of herdsmen and mountain farms,\nWhere men are few, and few tools, a few weapons, and their\ndawns are beautiful.\nFrom here for normal one sees both ways,\nAnd listens to the splendor of God, the exact poet, the sonorous\nAntistrophe of desolation to the strophe multitude.",

        "content": "Rocks, trees and rocks; and down a mossy stone\nThe murmuring ooze and trickle of a stream\nThrough bushes, where the mountain spring lies lone,\nA gleaming cairngorm where the shadows dream,\nAnd one wild road winds like a saffron seam.\n\nHere sang the thrush, whose pure, mellifluous note\nDropped golden sweetness on the fragrant June;\nHere cat and blue-bird and wood-sparrow wrote\nTheir presence on the silence with a tune;\nAnd here the fox drank 'neath the mountain moon.\n\nFrail ferns and dewy mosses and dark brush\nImpenetrable briers, deep and dense,\nAnd wiry bushes, brush, that seemed to crush\nThe struggling saplings with its tangle, whence\nSprawled out the ramble of an old rail-fence.\n\nA wasp buzzed by; and then a butterfly\nIn orange and amber, like a floating flame;\nAnd then a man, hard-eyed and very sly,\nGaunt-checked and haggard and a little lame,\nWith an old rifle, down the mountain came.\n\nHe listened, drinking from a flask he took\nOut of the ragged pocket of his coat;\nThen all around him cast a stealthy look;\nLay down; and watched an eagle soar and float,\nHis fingers twitching at his hairy throat.\n\nThe shades grew longer; and each Cumberland height\nLoomed, framed in splendours of the dolphin dusk.\nAround the road a horseman rode in sight;\nYoung, tall, blonde-bearded. Silent, grim, and brusque,\nHe in the thicket aimed The gun ran husk;\n\nAnd echoes barked among the hills and made\nRepeated instants of the shot's distress.\nthen silence and the trampled bushes swayed;\nThen silence, packed with murder and the press\nOf distant hoofs that galloped riderless.",
